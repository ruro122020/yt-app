# Notes

A simple youtube search application using google's api with React Hooks. [Demo](https://videos-hooks-peach-xi.vercel.app)

### Custom Hooks

1. Custom hooks is the best way to create reusable code in a React project (besides using component) by extracting hook-related code out of the function component. Custom hooks ALWAYS make use of at least one primitive hook internally and should have only one single purpose.

2. Data-fetching is great to try to make reusable.

3. When talking about custom hooks they are referring to the functions you create inside of a component. Not the jsx itself. To make jsx resuable in anyway always create another component.

4. A good process for creating a custom hook is to use this sentence:
   If you give me(custom hook) a list of inputs, I will give you (the developer) a list of outputs.

- Identify each line of code related to some single purpose
- Identify the inputs to that code
- Identify the outputs to that code
- Extract all of the code into a separate function, receiving the inputs as arguments, and returning the outputs

# Deploying Applications

### Vercel

To deploy on vercel use `vercel`\
To redeploy use `vercel --prod`

### Netlify

If you make any changes, push them to github and netlify will automatically rebuild application.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
